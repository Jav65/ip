# 🧠 AI Usage Log

I used AI (mostly ChatGPT and Claude) to validate whether my code structure was correct.

## 💡 How I Use AI

1. I write pseudocode or English descriptions outlining the code and its structural placement.
2. I input these into GPT and Claude to ask whether my abstraction and structure are sound.
3. I then implement the code myself.
4. I trust AI tools for generating Javadoc and ensuring adherence to coding standards.
5. I don’t usually trust the code generated by GPT because it doesn’t have full context of what I’m building. It sometimes makes incorrect assumptions or overcomplicates the logic by adding excessive guard clauses—even when I already have guard functions wrapping the logic.
6. I also use AI to correct grammar in this documentation.
7. I use AI to help design GUI layouts and component interactions, especially for early-stage prototyping and usability ideas.
8. I use AI to help write JUnit test code—especially for generating test scaffolding, edge case coverage, and verifying expected behavior.

## 🔍 Observations

### ✅ What Worked
- Validating abstractions and structure early saved time during implementation.
- Javadoc generation and coding standard suggestions were consistently helpful.
- Grammar correction was fast and accurate.

### ⚠️ What Didn’t Work
- Generated code often lacked contextual awareness and introduced unnecessary complexity.
- Guard logic was frequently redundant due to misunderstanding of existing safeguards.

### ⏱️ Time Saved
- Estimated **10–15%** reduction in time spent on documentation and structural validation.
- Minimal time saved on actual code generation due to manual rewrites.
- Avoided time-consuming rewrites by consulting AI early to confirm structural correctness.
